# Electronic Medical Records - FastAPIandDBMS

## EMR Database Design & FastAPI Integration (Guidance from https://www.facebook.com/aivietnam.edu.vn)
### üß† Overview
This repository showcases a collection of projects demonstrating how to use FastAPI with relational database management systems (DBMS) to build scalable, efficient backend systems. It includes both small-scale learning projects and a larger, academically-oriented project focused on designing a robust Electronic Medical Record (EMR) system database.

### üìò Contents
üîπ Small Projects
A series of mini-projects designed for learning purposes, including:

Basic FastAPI CRUD operations with MySQL/PostgreSQL.
User authentication systems.
RESTful APIs for managing students, books, inventory, and more.
Integration between Pydantic models and SQLAlchemy ORM.
These projects serve as stepping stones to prepare for more complex system design.

üî∏ Major Project: EMR Database Design
Project Title:
Design AI Agent for Electronic Medical Records(EMR)

1.üìå Problem Statement

Electronic Medical Records (EMR) are a critical component of healthcare digital transformation. They serve as a centralized system for storing, managing, and retrieving patient information in a consistent, efficient, and secure manner.

To develop an effective EMR system, the foundation lies in thorough business analysis and logical database design, which must accurately model clinical entities and their relationships.

2.üéØ Objective

This project aims to:

Apply academic principles of database design to the context of healthcare.
Bridge theoretical modeling with the unique operational characteristics of clinical environments.
Lay the groundwork for scalable, extensible healthcare information systems.

3.üèóÔ∏è Key Features

Entity-relationship (ER) modeling tailored for clinical workflows.
Normalized relational schema to ensure consistency and efficiency.
Secure and traceable access to medical data.
Scalable backend built with FastAPI for modern API-driven applications.

4.üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- Backend Framework: FastAPI
- Database: MySQL / PostgreSQL
- ORM: SQLAlchemy
- API Docs: Swagger / ReDoc (auto-generated by FastAPI)
- Tools: Docker (optional for deployment), - VSCode, MySQL Workbench
